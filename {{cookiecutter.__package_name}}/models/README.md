# Model

This repository is tracked by dvc, so that the models are versioned and can be shared with other contributors.

Consists of files representing trained/retrained models as part of build jobs, etc. The model names can be appropriately set as projectname_date_time or project_build_id (in case the model is created as part of build jobs).
